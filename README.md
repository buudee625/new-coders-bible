# New (n00b) Coders Bible ðŸ“”ðŸ“–ðŸ““

New to coding? Feel like noob? Yeah me too ðŸ¤“!

I'm sure every single new developer feels this at some point in their learning journey: "There is SO much to learn and to memorize!! ðŸ¤¯" As if learning a new language wasn't enough, we have to learn frameworks, figure out what the difference is between one thing from another. Then learn CS concepts, terminologies, different technologies, paradigms... THEN on top of that, we need to remember various commands for various tools. 

I know early on that there's no way my 1.44MB brain ðŸ’¾ðŸ§  is going to store all of that information, so I know I had to write it down somewhere and keep them organized.

So here it is, an ever growing list of references and information that I'm going to keep adding to as long as I code (at least that's the current goal).

If you find something helpful, fantastic ðŸ¤©! If you find an error, or something that can be improved or added, please feel free to reach out! ðŸ˜„

Happy coding!
