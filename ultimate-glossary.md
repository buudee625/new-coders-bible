## CS Concepts:

- **Function**: A block of code that takes input and returns an output

- **Void function**: A function that does not return a value or has no output

- **Recursion**: A function that calls on itself

- **Return**: Output a value

- **Expression**: Code that produces a value

- **Statement**: Code that performs a task, i.e. Conditional Statement

- **Call Stack**: A type of short term memory in computer used to execute codes

- **Statically Typed Language**: languages that do type checking at compile-time (i.e. Java, C, C++) (aka. Strongly-typed, Low-level)

- **Dynamically Typed Language**: languages that do type checking at¬†run-time (i.e. JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP)

- **Paradigms/Programming Paradigm**: A way to classify programming languages based on their features.
  [Wiki Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm), [Comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_paradigms)

  - Imperative: Programmer instructs the machine how to change its state.

  - Procedural: (i.e. C)

  - Object-Oriented:

  - Declarative: Programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it (i.e. Haskell)

  - Functional:

- **Byte code**: Byte code is an intermediate code between the source code and machine code. It is a low-level code that is the result of the compilation of a source code which is written in a high-level language.

  > Java Program > Java Compiler > Java Byte Code > Java Interpreter > Machine Code

- **Machine code**: Machine code consisting of binary instructions (1s and 0s) that are directly understandable by the CPU.

## Misc Glossary

- **Anagram**: A word or phrase made by using the letters of another word or phrase in a different order. e.g. Cat and Act.
- **Pangram**: A sentence or verse that contains all the letters of the alphabet. e.g. "A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
